    <h1>Avocado Lime Cheesecake</h1>
    <p>
        I love Mexican food, but I think Mexican desserts are limited. Flan is great, but not every time. This
        Mexican-inspired avocado and lime cheesecake recipe is unique, easy, and fabulous. My friends constantly ask me
        to make it. You must have an ice cream maker.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ cups heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 ½ ripe avocados, peeled and pitted</li>
            <li>2 (3 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li>½ cup fresh lime juice</li>
            <li>1 (8 inch) prepared graham cracker crust</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat cream in a small saucepan until small bubbles appear around the edges. Remove from the heat and
                stir in sugar until it dissolves. Transfer mixture to a medium bowl and allow to cool, about 10 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Blend avocado and cream cheese in a food processor until smooth. Add lime juice and process until
                smooth.
            </li>
            <li>Whisk blended avocado mixture into cooled cream mixture, then pour into an ice cream maker. Freeze
                according to the manufacturer's instructions, about 20 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Spoon avocado mixture into the prepared pie crust; smooth the surface with a spatula. Freeze until
                solid, at least 2 hours. Let cheesecake sit at room temperature until slightly softened yet firm enough
                to slice before serving, 10 to 15 minutes.
            </li>
        </ol>
